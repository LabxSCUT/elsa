        $ python --version
    if not, download and install it from: http://www.python.org 

    2. check numpy version is >= 1.0:
        $ pydoc numpy.version | grep version\ =
    if not, download and install it from: http://www.scipy.org

    3. check scipy version is >= 0.6:
        $ pydoc scipy.version | grep version\ =
    if not, download and install it from: http://www.scipy.org
    
    4. download LSA package from: 
        $ wget https://128.125.86.98/svn/lsa/tags/current/dist/lsa-0.0.2.tar.gz \

    8. test the excutables
        $ lsa-compuate.py -h
        $ lsa-query.py -h

    9. you can save your time by add these two lines into your shell profile file
        $ alias lsac="lsa-compute.py"
        $ alias lsaq="lsa-query.py"

    2. eye check numpy version is >= 1.0, it is at the last line:
        $ pydoc numpy.version
    if not, download and install it from: http://www.scipy.org

    3. check scipy version is >= 0.6, it is at the last line:
        $ pydoc scipy.version 
    if not, download and install it from: http://www.scipy.org
    
    4. download LSA package from:

       you can now check again by:
        > echo %PATH%
       
    7 test the executables:
        > lsa-compuate.py -h
        > lsa-query.py -h
    
    8. for analysis examples see documentation file at:
